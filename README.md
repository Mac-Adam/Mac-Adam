### Hi, Adam Here

#### About me

I've been programming since I was 15. Thought my journey, I ve tried many programming languages and technologies. I am interested not only in software, but also hardware. I like 3d printing, designing mechanical parts, electronics and in general everything that combines software with physical elements.
I am currently studying Automatic Control and Robotics.

#### What do I do when I am not programming?

In my free time I like to:

- fold Origami, you can check out some of my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/adam.origami?igsh=djhudjB1OTg1ZzR3)
- Play D&D
- Play computer games
- Play the keyboard (I am a beginner)
- Do some sports (mostly climbing and running)

### :hammer_and_wrench: What I did over the years:

Below you can read a short description of projects I've made over the years is roughly chronological order.

#### Electronic Scoreboard (C, Eagle)

Together with a friend as members of KNEI Knurów I've made an electronic scoreboard that is currently used by Primary School in Gierałtowice.
The Scoreboard electronics are custom designed based on ATMega8A. The 1.5m wide scoreboard is controlled via bluetooth using a companion app. This project enhanced the quality of tournaments held inside the school gym. The ease of use made it usable also during normal PE classes.

#### Rachmistrz app (Flutter, Dart)

Together with a Friend as a part of scholarship "Śląskie Inwestujemy w Talenty", I've created an app that reached the podium of "Kaliski Konkurs Informatyczny". The app was supposed to help with maths and physics. I consised of a few modules:

- Scientific Calculator
- List of constants and formulas
- A way to interact with the formulas, plug one into another and solve symbolically for a variable
- function graphing
- equation solver

#### SUILO website (React JS, Firebase)

I was one of 3 people responsible for creating a website of School council of LO1 in Gliwice. I was mainly responsible for backend. The website displayed most important information, upcoming events, helped students sell old books to new students and allowed every student to participate in online voting for the head of school council. The content on the website was easily editable with a user interface available for logged in users. You can view it in more details in pinned repos.

#### Wether Station (C, Eagle, CAD)

I've designed and made a wether station based on ESP32. Every part of it is suited for 3d printing. It consists of:

- Temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- Air quality sensor
- Custom Wind speed meter
- Custom Wind direction meter
- Custom rain meter

The project was made with my dad, [here](https://stacja.fun/) you can check out current wether on a website made by him.
I don't have a repo with the code and 3d models.

#### Hackathons and Others (React JS, NEXT JS, Python)

I've taken part in those Hackathons and competitions:

- BEST Gliwce 2022, Together with a friend we've made a web app that helps a single person as well as a group of people optimize the time.
- Kościuszkon 2024, We made a system that allows cities to simply and in real time control information displayed on screens around a city. It is an answer to the increasing amount of billboards filled with add and no useful information. Using our system a city could make sure the important information isn't lost while earning by selling add space.
- BEAST AGH, We've made a project of an autonomous vehicle.
- I've completed all the tasks in 2022 and 2023 Advent of Code

#### KN Integra Smashbot (C, CAD)

I am the coordinator of a Smashbot team, that is part of KN Integra. We have made a 3d printable battlebot. It is currently ready for battle, we are waiting for competitions to come.

#### Fractal Generator (C#, HLSL)

I've made a fractal generator using Unity and Shaders written in HLSL. I've implemented an arbitrary precision number system, so that It is possible to do extremely deep zooms. I've made a lot of performance enhancements as well as implement a lot of ways to visualize the fractal. This Is one of my biggest projects so far, I've described in more details in its repo.
